# macOS Update Prank

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a humorous and harmless prank website that imitates the macOS update process. Designed for entertainment purposes, it can be used to play a light-hearted joke on friends or colleagues.

## Features
- A realistic macOS update progress bar simulation.
- Customizable update duration through user prompts.
- Hidden mouse cursor to enhance the realism of the update screen.

## How It Works
The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render a fake macOS update screen. When a visitor arrives at the site, they are greeted with instructions and prompted to enter the desired duration of the update simulation. The progress bar will fill up over this period, concluding with a completion alert.

## Setup
To set up the prank website on your own server, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the files to your hosting environment.
3. Ensure the `script.js` file is linked correctly in the `index.html`.
4. Customize the prompts in the `script.js` if necessary.

## Usage
Direct your friends or colleagues to your hosted version of the website. The prank initiates when the website is loaded.
